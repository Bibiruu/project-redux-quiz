# Redux quiz group project

Project is a quiz for Friend sitcom fandom built using React, Redux and styled components. Project is made in mob programming. 

## The problem

The biggest problem was to understand and get data to summary component. We have learned: 
- how to change className 
- className in React.js returns a array, which needs to be iterated using a for loop
- separating styled components to target the designated components instead of dumping everything in Global styled component 
- modifying in the reducer to make the fetch in array easier
